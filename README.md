# Web-Design-Challenge
This project involved creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations based on the prior weather / api assignment. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where users can view the data used to build them.

PLEASE NOTE:  I found this HW much more challenging than other assignments, and struggled mightily with the layout concepts.
